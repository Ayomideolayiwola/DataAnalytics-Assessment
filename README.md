## Problem Statement
A company noticed that despite holding rich customer data across savings, investments, and transaction histories, they weren’t fully capitalizing on it for strategic decision-making. This presented an opportunity to explore data-driven business solutions through hands-on SQL analysis.

As a result, I developed a series of SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets—transforming raw customer and transaction data into actionable business intelligence. The queries are crafted to mirror real-world scenarios involving cross-sell targeting, behavioral segmentation, operational alerts, and lifetime value modeling.

### Scenarios Tackled

- Cross-Sell Targeting: Identified customers with both savings and investment plans. It was seen that high-value users with diversified products offer stronger lifetime value and conversion likelihood for cross-sell campaigns.
- Transaction Frequency: Segmented users based on monthly activity, behavior-based segmentation improved retention, email targeting, and personalized offers.
- Inactivity Alerts: Flagged accounts inactive for over a year to reduce operational risk. Proactive alerts enable better re-engagement strategies and reduce dormant asset overhead.
- CLV Estimation: Estimate simplified customer lifetime value to prioritize retention efforts. Marketing and finance teams gain a powerful metric to direct resources toward the most profitable segments.
